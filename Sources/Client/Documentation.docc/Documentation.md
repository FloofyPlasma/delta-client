# ``DeltaClient``

An open source Minecraft: Java Edition client built for speed.

## Overview

Delta Client is made up of two components: DeltaClient and DeltaCore. The DeltaClient package provides a SwiftUI-based user interface for the client, while DeltaCore provides all of the Minecraft functionality such as server connection, rendering and physics. If it's not UI or configuration, it's probably in DeltaCore.
